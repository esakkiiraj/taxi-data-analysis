🚖 Taxidata Analysis – Ola Rides (50,000+ Records)
Welcome to the Taxidata Analysis project! This repository features a complete analytical workflow using a simulated Ola dataset containing over 50,000 ride records. The project focuses on uncovering insights into ride patterns, booking trends, cancellation behaviors, and customer usage through data analysis and visualization.

🔍 Project Overview
The dataset simulates one month of ride activity and includes 20+ structured fields, such as:

Date & Time: Analyze peak hours and daily booking trends

Booking ID: Unique 10-digit identifiers (e.g., CNR12345678)

Booking Status: Successful, Cancelled (by Customer or Driver), or Incomplete

Vehicle Type: Auto, Bike, Mini, Prime Sedan, etc.

Pickup & Drop Locations: Randomized across multiple urban locations

Ride Metrics: VTAT (Vehicle Time to Arrive), CTAT (Customer Time to Arrive), ride distance, and fare value

Payment Method: Cash, Wallet, or Online

Cancellation Reason: Classified by type and reason (customer/driver)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
SQL – For data cleaning, querying, and exploration

Power BI – For building interactive dashboards and visual summaries

Python / Excel – For data simulation, preprocessing, and structuring
